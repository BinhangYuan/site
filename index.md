# About Me  

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am leading the [Relaxed System Lab](https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab). I am recruiting Ph.D. students to work on research topics, including machine learning for data management and distributed/decentralized machine learning systems. **Currently, I am focusing on recruiting students to work at the intersection between ML systems and high-performance hardware (GPU, TPU, NPU, etc) to support LLM services.** Please contact me by email with your latest resume if you are interested in joining us.

Before joining HKUST, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
I completed my Ph.D. program in the Computer Science Department at Rice University. My adviser was [Prof. Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/) and I was co-advised by [Prof. Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/) for my [Ph.D. thesis]([publications/Thesis.pdf](files/2020-PhD-Thesis.pdf)). I got my master degree from the Computer Science Department at Rice University, supervised by [Prof. Ron Goldman](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rng/), and a bachelor degree from the Computer Science Department at Fudan University guided by [Prof. Bo Yan](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/yanbo/en/index.htm) for research.

# Hobbies

Most of my spare time (if there is any) is spent on football. I am a big fan of Liverpool. As Klopp once said, "98% of football is about dealing with failure and still being able to smile and find joy in the game the next day.", which is also true for research, I believe.
